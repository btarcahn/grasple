##Brief introduction
Grasple is a project built for experimenting computer behaviors and complexities around Graph Theory's notions.
The project is currently open-source and is a work in progress. I mainly write this project to strengthen up my
proficiency in Java programming and learn some cool new stuffs, so enjoy yourself while being around.
