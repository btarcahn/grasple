## Brief introduction
<p>
Grasple <i>(Graphe Simple)</i> is a project working on Graph data structures.
I develop this project to improve my proficiency in the Java language, especially
using lambda abstractions and other cool new features.
</p>
<p>
Grasple runs on JDK11 to utilizes the most recent features of the
Java programming language. It also uses Gradle 5.4.1 as a build tool,
and JUnit 5 for unit testing. Therefore, make sure you have the
appropriate Java version for this projcet to work correctly.
